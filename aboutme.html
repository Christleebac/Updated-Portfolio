My name is Christian Lee E. Bacalla. I'm currently a 3rd year student sat CITE Technical Institute Inc.
I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is.
However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project.
I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly.
I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique
projects. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with
ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning
new things all the time. Currently, I'm still continuing  my dual-training system at Cebu Belmont Inc.
as technical support.
